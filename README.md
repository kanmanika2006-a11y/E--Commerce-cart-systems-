Step 1:

Open a text editor (like Notepad or VS Code) and create a new file named cart.html.



Step 2:

Write the basic HTML structure using <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.



Step 3:

In the body, create a few products with their names, prices, and “Add to Cart” buttons.

Example:

<button onclick="addToCart('Product A', 500)">Add to Cart</button>



Step 4:

Add a cart section to show selected items and the total amount.



Step 5:

Write a small JavaScript inside <script> tags to:

Add items to the cart

Show total price

Remove or clear items



Step 6:

Add some CSS styling (optional) to make the page look neat.



Step 7:

Save the file and open it in a web browser to test.
You can click “Add to Cart,” see the items added, and clear them when done.



Step 8:

Explain in simple words:

> “This program shows products on a webpage and allows users to add or remove them from a shopping cart using JavaScript.”
